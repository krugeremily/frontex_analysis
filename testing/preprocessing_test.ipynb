       "'Frontex General Industry Days: Innovation for\\nborder and coast guard functions\\n2023-11-16\\nJoin us on 6 and 7 December to contribute to innovative solutions for border and coast guard\\nfunctions. Frontex’s next general Industry Days will put innovation in the spotlight to reflect the core\\nrole of technology in European Integrated Border Management.\\nFrontex would like to invite industry representatives to demonstrate how innovation could support\\nborder and coast guard functions. Over the course of a two-day programme, 16 industry\\nrepresentatives will present their latest approaches, technologies, and solutions (whether already\\navailable on the market or under development), which can benefit border management activities at\\nthe EU’s external borders and within the EU area, in respect of EU regulations.\\nThe first day of the event will have a broad scope, it will be dedicated to innovative solutions in\\nsupport of law enforcement activities regarding border management.\\nThe second day will focus on remote sensing technologies for electromagnetic signatures\\nrecognition and state-of-the-art sensors for surveillance purposes (land based, shipborne,\\nairborne, mobile, etc.).\\nThese areas of focus should not be considered as exhaustive; other technological solutions will be\\nconsidered if relevant for border management.\\nPractical information\\nWhat are Industry Days?\\nIndustry Days are a platform to interact and engage with experts from the European Border and Coast\\nGuard community. The goal is to create a forum where participants can freely discuss the proposed\\ntechnological innovations.\\nFrontex - European Border and Coast Guard Agency\\nwww.frontex.europa.eu | Pl. Europejski 6, 00-844 Warsaw, Poland | Tel. +48 22 205 95 00 | Fax +48 22 205 95 01The Industry Days will be held in an online format which will host engaging presentations and\\ndynamic discussions, alongside an interactive digital exhibition platform. Each participating entity will\\nbe granted a 40-minute slot; during this time a presentation, Q&A session, and collaborative\\ndiscussions will be held.\\nWho can participate and how to register?\\nIf your organisation is at the forefront of these transformative technological advancements and you\\nwish to present your innovation, we invite you to register.\\nFollow this registration link to sign-up for the upcoming Industry Days. Please provide an overview\\nof the technology you wish to showcase. Registration will be open until 27 November.\\nAttendance is by invitation only; more information will be communicated separately to the selected\\napplicants. Technological solutions must respect the legal limitations resulting from the European\\nUnion data protection rules and human rights provisions.\\nHow will the submissions be evaluated?\\nAll submissions will be evaluated internally, ensuring alignment with the needs of the European\\nBorder and Coast Guard community while guaranteeing the fair and transparent treatment of all\\nparticipants. Every significant contribution will be displayed on our dedicated online platform.\\nError! No text of specified style in document. 2/02'"
